This error typically occurs when using Expo CLI with older versions of Node.js or when there are inconsistencies in your project setup.  It often manifests during the build process, especially when trying to create a standalone APK or IPA.

```javascript
// Example code snippet where the error might occur (Illustrative - actual code varies)
expo build:android
```

The error message itself might not be extremely specific, sometimes mentioning issues with native modules, build configurations, or missing dependencies.  The root cause often lies in a mismatch between Expo's expected environment and your actual environment.
